# Tibetan-Naming-Data
Tashi Delek! I'm Tashi and self teaching Data Analytics. I've finished a Google Coursera Professional Certificate on Data Analysis. I want to make a Open Data on Tibetan Naming and also wish to analyze different Tibetan names, want to compare names against years and places, etc. My goal is to have small analytics research on Tibetan Names.
